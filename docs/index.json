Its main risk factors are higher age and preoperative cognitive deficits. These are also main risk factors for long-term cognitive decline after DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for POD severity after DBS surgery in PD. METHODS: 57 patients underwent DBS (21 female; age 60.2$±$8.2; disease duration 10.5$±$5.9 years). Preoperatively, general, PD- and surgery-specific predictors were recorded. Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the neuropsychological test battery CANTAB ConnectTM were used to test domain-specific cognition. Volumes of the cholinergic basal forebrain were calculated with voxel-based morphometry. POD severity was recorded with the delirium scales Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Nursing Delirium Scale (NU-DESC). Spearman correlations were calculated for univariate analysis of predictors and POD severity and linear regression with elastic net regularization and leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to fit a multivariable model. RESULTS: 21 patients (36.8%) showed mainly mild courses of POD following DBS. Correlation between predicted and true POD severity was significant (spearman rho = 0.365, p = 0.001). Influential predictors were age (p \u003c 0.001), deficits in attention and motor speed (p = 0.002), visual learning (p = 0.036) as well as working memory (p \u003c 0.001), Nucleus basalis of Meynert volumes (p = 0.003) and burst suppression (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: General but also PD- and surgery-specific factors were predictive of POD severity. These findings underline the multifaceted etiology of POD after DBS in PD. Valid predictive models must therefore consider general, PD- and surgery-specific factors.","tags":["Parkinson's disease; cognition; deep brain stimulation; outcome; personalized therapy; postoperative delirium; risk prediction"],"title":"Risk Factors for Postoperative Delirium Severity After Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in Parkinson's Disease","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Anna-Maria Hartner","Xiang Li","Susy Echeverria-Londono","Jeremy Roth","Kaja Abbas","Megan Auzenbergs","Margaret Villiers","Matthew Ferrari","Keith Fraser","Han Fu","Timothy Hallett","Wes Hinsley","Mark Jit","Andromachi Karachaliou","Sean Moore","Shevanthi Nayagam","Timos Papadopoulos","Alex Perkins","Allison Portnoy","Katy Gaythorpe"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1711929600,"objectID":"60284d9e76844e2e9d0f8755aa235f8f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/journal-article/hartner-lancet-2024/","publishdate":"2024-08-08T08:26:05.521105Z","relpermalink":"/publications/journal-article/hartner-lancet-2024/","section":"publications","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"Estimating the health effects of COVID-19-related immunisation disruptions in 112 countries during 2020-30: a modelling study","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Ivan Nenchev","Tatjana Scheffler","Marie de la Fuente","Heiner Stuke","Benjamin Wilck","Sandra Anna Just","Christiane Montag"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1709251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709251200,"objectID":"2827cd96d8c11ae175b94edaf28f6d85","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/conference-paper/nenchev-etal-2024-linguistic/","publishdate":"2024-08-08T07:46:36.341356Z","relpermalink":"/publications/conference-paper/nenchev-etal-2024-linguistic/","section":"publications","summary":"We present a study of the linguistic output of the German-speaking writer Robert Walser using NLP. We curated a corpus comprising texts written by Walser during periods of sound health, and writings from the year before his hospitalization, and writings from the first year of his stay in a psychiatric clinic, all likely at- tributed to schizophrenia. Within this corpus, we identified and analyzed a total of 20 lin- guistic markers encompassing established met- rics for lexical diversity, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity. Additionally, we ex- plored lesser-known markers such as lexical innovation, concreteness, and imageability. No- tably, we introduced two additional markers for phonological similarity for the first time within this context. Our findings reveal sig- nificant temporal dynamics in these markers closely associated with Walser′s contempora- neous diagnosis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between these markers, leveraging them for classification of the schizophrenic episode.","tags":[],"title":"Linguistic markers of schizophrenia: a case study of Robert Walser","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Anna-Maria Hartner","Xiang Li","Katy Gaythorpe"],"categories":null,"content":"Objectives We conducted a rapid review to determine the extent that immunisation services in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and synthesised the factors that can be used to build resilience in future.Design Rapid review reported in accordance with the Preferred reporting for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.Data sources PubMed and Web of Science were searched through 6 October 2023.Eligibility criteria for selecting studies We included studies that focused on disruption to immunisation activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs.

This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called “super-human” AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans. In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test. Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans. In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate. Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input. Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals. In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively. In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence. Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.\n","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"616ffe2b2b5e7ab09c55870d8f3ac1cc","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/preprint/korber-2024-measureintelligencelargelanguage/","publishdate":"2024-08-07T15:19:25.92307Z","relpermalink":"/publications/preprint/korber-2024-measureintelligencelargelanguage/","section":"publications","summary":"With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention.

Potentially, this presents a fundamentally new situation for research, as before the Digital Services Act, few platforms granted data access or only to very selective groups of researchers. The access regime under the Digital Services Act is, however, still evolving. Specifics such as the application procedure for researcher access are still being worked out and results can be expected in spring 2024. The impact of the Digital Services Act on research will therefore only become fully apparent in the future.\n","tags":[],"title":"The role of the (in)accessibility of social media data for infodemic management: a public health perspective on the situation in the European Union in March 2024","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Shurendar Kumar","Anna-Maria Hartner","Arunah Chandran","Katy Gaythorpe","Xiang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698796800,"objectID":"8291dd79fcb52fca9f78b268dd0605f4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/journal-article/shurendar-bmc-2023/","publishdate":"2024-08-08T08:26:02.290939Z","relpermalink":"/publications/journal-article/shurendar-bmc-2023/","section":"publications","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating effective measles vaccine coverage in the Malaysian population accounting for between-dose correlation and vaccine efficacy","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Silvan Wehrli","Bert Arnrich","Christopher Irrgang"],"categories":null,"content":"This work introduces a benchmark assessing the performance of clustering German text embeddings in different domains. This benchmark is driven by the increasing use of clustering neural text embeddings in tasks that require the grouping of texts (such as topic modeling) and the need for German resources in existing benchmarks. We provide an initial analysis for a range of pre-trained mono- and multilingual models evaluated on the outcome of different clustering algorithms. Results include strong performing mono- and multilingual models. Reducing the dimensions of embeddings can further improve clustering. Additionally, we conduct experiments with continued pre-training for German BERT models to estimate the benefits of this additional training. Our experiments suggest that significant performance improvements are possible for short text.

The One Health approach links human, animal, and environmental sectors with the goal of achieving a holistic understanding of health in general. To implement this approach, diverse and heterogeneous data streams and types must be combined and analyzed. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer new opportunities for cross-sectoral assessment of current and future health threats. Using the example of antimicrobial resistance as a global threat in the One Health context, we demonstrate potential applications and challenges of AI techniques.This article provides an overview of different applications of AI techniques in the context of One Health and highlights their challenges. Using the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), an increasing global threat, as an example, existing and future AI-based approaches to AMR containment and prevention are described. These range from novel drug development and personalized therapy, to targeted monitoring of antibiotic use in livestock and agriculture, to comprehensive environmental surveillance.","tags":[],"title":"Application areas of artificial intelligence in the context of One Health with a focus on antimicrobial resistance","type":"publications"},{"authors":["T Sonia Boender","Paula Helene Schneider","Claudia Houareau","Silvan Wehrli","Tina D Purnat","Atsuyoshi Ishizumi","Elisabeth Wilhelm","Christopher Voegeli","Lothar H Wieler","Christina Leuker"],"categories":null,"content":"Background: To respond to the need to establish infodemic management functions at the national public health institute in Germany (Robert Koch Institute, RKI), we explored and assessed available data sources, developed a social listening and integrated analysis framework, and defined when infodemic management functions should be activated during emergencies.\nObjective: We aimed to establish a framework for social listening and integrated analysis for public health in the German context using international examples and technical guidance documents for infodemic management.\nMethods: This study completed the following objectives: identified (potentially) available data sources for social listening and integrated analysis; assessed these data sources for their suitability and usefulness for integrated analysis in addition to an assessment of their risk using the RKI’s standardized data protection requirements; developed a framework and workflow to combine social listening and integrated analysis to report back actionable infodemic insights for public health communications by the RKI and stakeholders; and defined criteria for activating integrated analysis structures in the context of a specific health event or health emergency.\nResults: We included and classified 38{%} (16/42) of the identified and assessed data sources for social listening and integrated analysis at the RKI into 3 categories: social media and web-based listening data, RKI-specific data, and infodemic insights.

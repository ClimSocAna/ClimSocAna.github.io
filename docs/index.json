Understanding the public discourse is essential for effective communication and misinformation mitigation. Computational methods can aid these efforts through online social listening. We combined hierarchical text clus- tering and sentiment analysis to examine the face mask-wearing discourse in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic using a dataset of 353,420 German X (formerly Twitter) posts from 2020. For sentiment analysis, we annotated a subsample of the data to train a neural network for classifying the sentiments of posts (neutral, negative, or positive). In combination with clustering, this approach uncovered sentiment patterns of different topics and their subtopics, reflecting the online public response to mask mandates in Germany. We show that our approach can be used to examine long-term narratives and sentiment dynamics and to identify specific topics that explain peaks of interest in the social media discourse.\n","date":1722988800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1722988800,"objectID":"ebc32cada107d73ca8ca5ef2b9a7f679","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/24-08-07-wassa-paper/","publishdate":"2024-08-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/24-08-07-wassa-paper/","section":"news","summary":"Our paper Guiding Sentiment Analysis with Hierarchical Text Clustering: Analyzing the German X/Twitter Discourse on Face Masks in the 2020 COVID-19 is accepted at the 14th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment \u0026 Social Media Analysis (WASSA), which takes place at the ACL 2024 conference.\n","tags":null,"title":"WASSA @ ACL 2024 Paper accepted!","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our abstract “High-resolution modeling and projection of heat-related mortality in Germany under climate change” got accepted for the upcoming European Public Health conference in Lisbon, taking place on November 13-15, 2024, in Lisbon, Portugal.

Its main risk factors are higher age and preoperative cognitive deficits. These are also main risk factors for long-term cognitive decline after DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for POD severity after DBS surgery in PD. METHODS: 57 patients underwent DBS (21 female; age 60.2$±$8.2; disease duration 10.5$±$5.9 years). Preoperatively, general, PD- and surgery-specific predictors were recorded. Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the neuropsychological test battery CANTAB ConnectTM were used to test domain-specific cognition. Volumes of the cholinergic basal forebrain were calculated with voxel-based morphometry. POD severity was recorded with the delirium scales Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Nursing Delirium Scale (NU-DESC). Spearman correlations were calculated for univariate analysis of predictors and POD severity and linear regression with elastic net regularization and leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to fit a multivariable model. RESULTS: 21 patients (36.8%) showed mainly mild courses of POD following DBS. Correlation between predicted and true POD severity was significant (spearman rho = 0.365, p = 0.001). Influential predictors were age (p \u003c 0.001), deficits in attention and motor speed (p = 0.002), visual learning (p = 0.036) as well as working memory (p \u003c 0.001), Nucleus basalis of Meynert volumes (p = 0.003) and burst suppression (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: General but also PD- and surgery-specific factors were predictive of POD severity. These findings underline the multifaceted etiology of POD after DBS in PD. Valid predictive models must therefore consider general, PD- and surgery-specific factors.","tags":["Parkinson's disease; cognition; deep brain stimulation; outcome; personalized therapy; postoperative delirium; risk prediction"],"title":"Risk Factors for Postoperative Delirium Severity After Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in Parkinson's Disease","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Anna-Maria Hartner","Xiang Li","Susy Echeverria-Londono","Jeremy Roth","Kaja Abbas","Megan Auzenbergs","Margaret Villiers","Matthew Ferrari","Keith Fraser","Han Fu","Timothy Hallett","Wes Hinsley","Mark Jit","Andromachi Karachaliou","Sean Moore","Shevanthi Nayagam","Timos Papadopoulos","Alex Perkins","Allison Portnoy","Katy Gaythorpe"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1711929600,"objectID":"60284d9e76844e2e9d0f8755aa235f8f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/journal-article/hartner-lancet-2024/","publishdate":"2024-08-08T08:26:05.521105Z","relpermalink":"/publications/journal-article/hartner-lancet-2024/","section":"publications","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"Estimating the health effects of COVID-19-related immunisation disruptions in 112 countries during 2020-30: a modelling study","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Ivan Nenchev","Tatjana Scheffler","Marie de la Fuente","Heiner Stuke","Benjamin Wilck","Sandra Anna Just","Christiane Montag"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1709251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709251200,"objectID":"2827cd96d8c11ae175b94edaf28f6d85","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/conference-paper/nenchev-etal-2024-linguistic/","publishdate":"2024-08-08T07:46:36.341356Z","relpermalink":"/publications/conference-paper/nenchev-etal-2024-linguistic/","section":"publications","summary":"We present a study of the linguistic output of the German-speaking writer Robert Walser using NLP. We curated a corpus comprising texts written by Walser during periods of sound health, and writings from the year before his hospitalization, and writings from the first year of his stay in a psychiatric clinic, all likely at- tributed to schizophrenia. Within this corpus, we identified and analyzed a total of 20 lin- guistic markers encompassing established met- rics for lexical diversity, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity. Additionally, we ex- plored lesser-known markers such as lexical innovation, concreteness, and imageability. No- tably, we introduced two additional markers for phonological similarity for the first time within this context. Our findings reveal sig- nificant temporal dynamics in these markers closely associated with Walser′s contempora- neous diagnosis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between these markers, leveraging them for classification of the schizophrenic episode.","tags":[],"title":"Linguistic markers of schizophrenia: a case study of Robert Walser","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Nils Körber","Silvan Wehrli","Christopher Irrgang"],"categories":null,"content":"With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention. This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called “super-human” AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans. In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test. Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans. In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate. Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input. Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals. In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively. In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence. Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.\n","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"616ffe2b2b5e7ab09c55870d8f3ac1cc","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/preprint/korber-2024-measureintelligencelargelanguage/","publishdate":"2024-08-07T15:19:25.92307Z","relpermalink":"/publications/preprint/korber-2024-measureintelligencelargelanguage/","section":"publications","summary":"With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention.

By analyzing the viral genetic material present in wastewater, public health officials can gain early insights into the spread of the virus and inform timely intervention measures. The construction of reference datasets from known SARS-CoV-2 lineages and their mutation profies has become state-of-the-art for assigning viral lineages and their relative abundances from wastewater sequencing data. However, the selection of reference sequences or mutations directly affects the predictive power.Results Here, we show the impact of a mutation- and sequence-based reference reconstruction for SARS-CoV-2 abundance estimation. We benchmark three data sets: 1) synthetic “spike-in” mixtures, 2) German samples from early 2021, mainly comprising Alpha, and 3) samples obtained from wastewater at an international airport in Germany from the end of 2021, including 1rst signals of Omicron. The two approaches differ in sub-lineage detection, with the marker-mutation-based method, in particular, being challenged by the increasing number of mutations and lineages. However, the estimations of both approaches depend on selecting representative references and optimized parameter settings. By performing parameter escalation experiments, we demonstrate the effects of reference size and alternative allele frequency cutoffs for abundance estimation. We show how different parameter settings can lead to different results for our test data sets, and illustrate the effects of virus lineage composition of wastewater samples and references.Conclusions Here, we compare a mutation- and sequence-based reference construction and assignment for SARS-CoV-2 abundance estimation from wastewater samples. Our study highlights current computational challenges, focusing on the general reference design, which significantly and directly impacts abundance allocations. We illustrate advantages and disadvantages that may be relevant for further developments in the wastewater community and in the context of higher standardization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of reference design on estimating SARS-CoV-2 lineage abundances from wastewater sequencing data","type":"publications"}]

 abstract = {Objectives We conducted a rapid review to determine the extent that immunisation services in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and synthesised the factors that can be used to build resilience in future.Design Rapid review reported in accordance with the Preferred reporting for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.Data sources PubMed and Web of Science were searched through 6 October 2023.Eligibility criteria for selecting studies We included studies that focused on disruption to immunisation activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. Outcomes included routine vaccine coverage, supplementary immunisation activities, vaccine doses, timing of vaccination, supply chain changes, and factors contributing to disruption or resilience.Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers used standardised methods to search, screen and code studies. Quality assessment was performed using a modified version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative research. Findings were summarised qualitatively.Results Of 4978 identified studies, 85 met the eligibility criteria. Included studies showed declines in immunisation activities across LMICs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These included reductions in achieved routine coverage, cancellation or postponement of campaigns and underimmunised cohorts. Immunisation was most disrupted in the early months of the pandemic; however, recovery varied by country, age-group and vaccine. Though many countries observed partial recovery in 2020, disruption in many countries continued into 2021. It has also been noted that clinician staff shortages and vaccine stock-outs caused by supply chain disruptions contributed to immunisation delays, but that concern over COVID-19 transmission was a leading factor. Key resiliency factors included community outreach and healthcare worker support.Conclusions There is limited information on whether reductions in vaccination coverage or delays have persisted beyond 2021. Further research is needed to assess ongoing disruptions and identify missed vaccine cohorts.All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information.},

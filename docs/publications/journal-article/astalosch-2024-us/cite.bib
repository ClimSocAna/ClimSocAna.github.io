 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a serious
complication following deep brain stimulation (DBS) but only
received little attention. Its main risk factors are higher age
and preoperative cognitive deficits. These are also main risk
factors for long-term cognitive decline after DBS in Parkinson's
disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for POD
severity after DBS surgery in PD. METHODS: 57 patients underwent
DBS (21 female; age 60.2$±$8.2; disease duration 10.5$±$5.9
years). Preoperatively, general, PD- and surgery-specific
predictors were recorded. Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the
neuropsychological test battery CANTAB ConnectTM were used to
test domain-specific cognition. Volumes of the cholinergic basal
forebrain were calculated with voxel-based morphometry. POD
severity was recorded with the delirium scales Confusion
Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Nursing
Delirium Scale (NU-DESC). Spearman correlations were calculated
for univariate analysis of predictors and POD severity and linear
regression with elastic net regularization and leave-one-out
cross-validation was performed to fit a multivariable model.
RESULTS: 21 patients (36.8%) showed mainly mild courses of POD
following DBS. Correlation between predicted and true POD
severity was significant (spearman rho = 0.365, p = 0.001).
Influential predictors were age (p < 0.001), deficits in
attention and motor speed (p = 0.002), visual learning (p =
0.036) as well as working memory (p < 0.001), Nucleus basalis of
Meynert volumes (p = 0.003) and burst suppression (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: General but also PD- and surgery-specific factors
were predictive of POD severity. These findings underline the
multifaceted etiology of POD after DBS in PD. Valid predictive
models must therefore consider general, PD- and surgery-specific
factors.},
